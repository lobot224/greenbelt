    "In this lab, you will be putting your Pandas skills to the test by working with a fun data set regarding super hero characters (Marvel vs DC)! You will be working with 3 **Pandas data frames** to process the information regarding the superheros to find out which universe is the best. Additionally, you will be challenged to build, modify, index, and slice these data frames to identify key pieces of data that will help you better make your decision. \n",

    "Superheros are a large part of the of the entertainment industry. In the early 20th century comic books were produced with characters who possessed fantastical powers, fought crime, and taught the readers a lesson or two about universal morals. Today, superheros have become larger than life; books, movies, TV-shows, conventions, fan-groups, and online-blogs make up the ever evolving world of super heros.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main outfits of superhero fiction, Marvel, and DC. These leaders in superhero storytelling have created entire 'universes' for their superheros to live in and interact with one another. Superheros have been grabbing the attention of views for almost a century using fantastical powers, it is time for you to put your data science powers to the test!\n",
